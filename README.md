# Quadratic Equation Solver

Real and complex roots are supported, but not complex coefficients. Loss of precision due to round-off error and other conditions is detected where possible and computation is aborted. A mixed approach is used in place of the Quadratic Formula to avoid subtractive cancellation. Newton's Method is used to compute the square root.
